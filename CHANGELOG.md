# Changelog

## Transactional

### 1.0.38
* A change was made to `mailchimp-transactional-php` - the API client will now always return an `Exception`, instead of an `Exception` or a string, when the API returns an error. Having to parse the response as a string was found to be a bit clunky.

### 1.0.37
* Added a changelog, which will be used to describe changes to both transactional and marketing client libraries.

## Marketing

### 3.0.63
* Added a changelog, which will be used to describe changes to both transactional and marketing client libraries.
